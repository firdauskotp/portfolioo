                        Hello, I am Firdaus. I am a computer engineering student from UniKL MIIT.
                        I have over 3 experience in the field of coding and hardware as well as 1
                        year experience in the Internet of Things. I am currently doing my internship
                        in Kidocode, Mount Kiara.

                        <h3>KnP Tracking Device</h3>
                        <p>
                        Kids and Pets Tracking Device, also known as KnP Tracking Device, is a 
                        project a friend and I work on. The main purpose of the device is to be able
                        to track kids and pets so that they don't go missing as that has become a 
                        serious issue as of late. How the device works is that once the switch is turned
                        on, the SIM card in the GSM module will send the current location's longitude 
                        and latitude that it obtained from the GPS module to the user's 
                        smartphone via SMS. As an innovation, this device uses the Internet 
                        of Things concept. Usually tracking devices just send the longitude 
                        and latitude to the user's phone. However, for our project, the SMS
                        will also contain a Google Map link. If the user has access to Internet
                        connection, the link can be clicked and the user will be redirected to
                        Google Maps, where it will show the current location of the device.</p>
